# Salesforce Design Patterns

This repository includes an examples of patterns realisation in Apex. 


## Factory Method

The factory method is just a method, it can be overridden in a subclass, whereas the abstract factory is an object that has multiple factory methods on it.

Examples:

- [Factory Method Test](https://github.com/acx-eduard-panin/salesforce-design-patterns/blob/main/src/main/default/classes/FactoryMethodTest.cls)
- [Apex Test Data Factory](https://github.com/benahm/TestDataFactory)

## Builder

The builder pattern is used to instantiate an object of a complex class using the step-by-step
approach and return a constructed object at once. Allows creating different products based on the same process.

Examples:
