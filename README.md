# Salesforce Design Patterns

This repository includes an examples of patterns realisation in Apex. 


## Factory Method

The factory method is just a method, it can be overridden in a subclass, whereas the abstract factory is an object that has multiple factory methods on it.

Examples:

- [Factory Method Test](https://github.com/acx-eduard-panin/salesforce-design-patterns/blob/main/src/main/default/classes/FactoryMethodTest.cls)
- [Apex Test Data Factory](https://github.com/benahm/TestDataFactory)

## Builder

The builder pattern is used to instantiate an object of a complex class using the step-by-step
approach and return a constructed object at once. Allows creating different products based on the same process.

Examples:
</br>
- [Builder Test](https://github.com/acx-eduard-panin/salesforce-design-patterns/blob/main/src/main/default/classes/BuilderTest.cls)
- [Apex-query-builder](https://github.com/4an70m/apex-query-builder)

## Interpreter

Interpreter pattern is used to defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this syntax.

- This pattern is used in SOQL parsing, symbol processing engine etc.
- This pattern performs upon a hierarchy of expressions. Each expression here is a terminal or non-terminal.
- The tree contains the expressions to be evaluated and is usually generated by a parser. The parser itself is not a part of the interpreter pattern.

Examples:

- [Interpreter Test](https://github.com/acx-eduard-panin/salesforce-design-patterns/blob/main/src/main/default/classes/InterpreterTest.cls)
- [Script](https://github.com/PropicSignifi/Script.apex)
